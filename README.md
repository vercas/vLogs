Portable logging library for .NET

---

I've written this library in summer 2014 for a project of mine. I know the toolset is not yet complete (e.g. no tool for translating from binary to text yet) and I may get around to implementing it eventually.  
*Note*: the code is there; wrapping tools aren't.

Also, it works flawlessly on Mono.  
Feel free to use it.
